**Sparkify: Churn Prediction Modelling**

The idea behind the project is to clean the date, explore for insights and train a machine learning model that can predict the user churn for the Sparkify music streaming service using PySpark.
The analysis was done on a subset of a much larger dataset, which falls under the Big Data category, however the code could be applied to the same.
PySpark libraries were utilized for this project as it is effecient for dealing with Big datasets and the code deployed here could be used on the complete dataset.


**Running the code**:
To run the code, firstly start by unzipping/uncompressing the dataset file, **mini_sparkify_event_data.rar** ans saving it in the same directory as the notebook **Sparkify.ipynb**.
From thereon, the notebook can be run as normal.
To access the dataset in this repository, kinldy note that you will need to unzip/uncompress the **mini_sparkify_event_data.rar** file.

**Files**:
	- Sparkify.ipynb 
 	- Sparkify.html
  	- mini_sparkify_event_data.rar
 
**The project includes the below major parts**:	
	- Data import and cleaning
	- Data exploration
	- Feature Engineering
	- Machine learning preparation/preprocessing
	- Machine learning modeling

**Libraries used**:
	- pyspark
 		- pyspark.sql
   		- pyspark.ml
	- pandas
