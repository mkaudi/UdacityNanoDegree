Sparkify: Churn Prediction Modelling

The idea behind the project is to train a machine learning model that can predict the user churn for the Sparkify music website using PySpark.
The analysis was done on a subset of a much larger data set, which falls under the Big Data category, however the code could be applied to the same.

To achieve this goal, the below were the major activities that had to be undertaken


The project includes the below major part:
	- Data import and cleaning
	- Data exploration
	- Feature Engineering
	- Machine learning preparation/preprocessing
	- Machine learning modeling

Libraries used:
	- pyspark
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- seaborn
