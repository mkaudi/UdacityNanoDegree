This program is a hands-on experience running data pipelines, designing experiments, building recommendation systems, and more.

Below are the details of the successfully completed projects.

**Project 1**

Exploratory Data Analysis on the Expected Years of Schooling (EYS)

The Expected Years of Schooling (EYS) is a pivotal educational metric aimed at evaluating the anticipated years of formal education an individual is expected to receive in a given country or region.
The Project looks into understanding the EYS, how different countries in different continents compare as well as how it has changed over the years.

The dataset was acquired from kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/years-of-schooling-worldwide

**Project 2**

Disaster Response Pipeline

The project entails creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize messages during disaster events and send them to the relevant people.
The end output is an app that a user can use to enter the message, and it will be categorized into the different emergency event category.

**Project 3**

Recommendations with IBM

The project involves analysis of user's interactions with articles and creating a recommendation system that can recommend articles based on those interaction and those of other users who have similar interactions.
Project Breakdown

The project was broken down into blocks as per below:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis 
II. Rank Based Recommendations 
III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering 
IV. Matrix Factorization

**Project 4**

Sparkify: Churn Prediction Modelling

The idea behind the project is to clean the date, explore for insights and train a machine learning model that can predict the user churn for the Sparkify music streaming service using PySpark. 
The analysis was done on a subset of a much larger dataset, which falls under the Big Data category, however the code could be applied to the same. PySpark libraries were utilized for this project as it is effecient for dealing with Big datasets and the code deployed here could be used on the complete dataset.

The dataset was provided by Udacity as part of the training and appreciations go out ot he team for the effort, knowledge and skills they shared.
