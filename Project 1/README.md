**Expected Years of Schooling (EYS)**

The Expected Years of Schooling (EYS) is a pivotal educational metric aimed at evaluating the anticipated years of formal education an individual is expected to receive in a given country or region.

The Project looks into understanding the EYS, how different countries in different continents compare as well as how it has changed over the years.

**We further look to answer these questions:**
  1. How do the different areas (Continents, Hemispheres, Development areas) compare in relation to the EYS?
	2. What has been the movement over the years for the different areas?
	3. What is the relationship between the Human Development Index Rank for 2021 and the EYS?
